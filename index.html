  <h1>Who I am </h1>
  <p>My name is Julian Duran and I was born and raised in Arizona. I have a wide array of interest in science and engineering. I started programming when I was about 10 ears old.
My first website I published on a shared server called Geocities that Yahoo later bought. I went to college at DeVry University and started out in computer information systems
but when the economy collapsed I chose to go to school for something completely different. I got my Degree in Clinical Laboratory Science and have been working in blood banks for
about five years now. I never felt the click with my job and always found myself going back to coding and programming. I tried to stay in the loop but so much changed so fast that
it was hard to keep up with the times when you have other responsibilities. I wanted back into my true passion which was computer programming so thats why I am here at Galvanize.
